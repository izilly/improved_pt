#Improved PhantasyTour (Chrome Extension)
Improves your Phantasy Tour viewing experience.

##Features
### Threads
* Embeds *all* direct images and videos
  * If image has "clickable text" then the text is turned to black to avoid confusion
  * If image is auto-linked then the link is hidden
  * Some images may not work (not direct links)
  * Click on image to open in new window.
  * If a picture is inside of a quote it will not be loaded to avoid redundancy.
  * Choose the color of image links (defaults to blue)
  * Choose whether or not to show images on load or on click (defaults to click to avoid angry girlfriends)
  * Won't load videos if more than 10 appear on a single page
* Context Menu (right click)
  * Open all pictures and videos
  * Close all pictures and videos
  * Close single picture
* Improved "Latest Posts" (The Latest Posts was always buggy and annoying, but now it should work perfectly and faster than before)
* Dynamic Posting (When you post, it will load all new posts along with your posts immediately in the same page. You can disable this in your settings and it will send you back to the homepage after posts)
  * **After dynamic posting/loading new posts, date overlays will not work [for now]**
* Improved MT button
  * If a thread is already in "My Threads" a check will already be there
  * Click on the MT button and if successful, a check will appear
* Recolors posts so they have the correct colors even if one is hidden due to the "ignore" feature
* Disable scroll bar in posts (enabled by default, can change in options)

### Topics
* Setting added to open first page of thread instead of last (defaults to last)
* Topic List colors threads properly (ignored threads mess it up)
